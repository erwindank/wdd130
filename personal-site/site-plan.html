        Business that are not findable on the internet might have difficulty getting more clients. A lot of people rely heavily on what they find online for options to get the product or service that they need. You might be missing customers just because your business location, website, phone number, or even open hours, are not findable online. You yourself might have gotten frustrated at the fact that you cannot seem to find the product or service you need with a small google search. We at Ubícame GT want to help you and the communities to grow by making as many businesses available at every possible platform offered. Some people use Google, some go directly to Google Maps, or Waze, while others use Facebook, or Instagram to find what they are looking for. They could be finding you instead of your competition, or the big companies that do show they are located at Mall’s kiosks, or stores, or that are already widely known locally. If you don’t know how or would like to get a hand increasing your chances of being found, we are here for you. We offer completely free support on getting your business to be easily visible and findable on Social media, Google Maps, Waze, Facebook, and Instagram. We are also open to lend a hand with setting up Whatsap Business, Telegram, Messenger, Snapchat, Twitter, and other Social networks that may allow your potential clients to find you. 

        The kind of business we can help are pharmacies, neighborhood convenience stores, bakeries, meat stores, temporary food sales, car washes, fruit and vegetable stands, restaurants, gifts stores, tortilla stores, barbershops, pet shops, gyms, laundromats, miscellaneous stores, and basically any business that has no online presence or that wishes to have better online presence, regardeless of the business size. If I did not mention your business type we will still help you. We want your local neighborhood to bloom economically by having more access to find business close by that have what you offer

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>The way it works is that we will help creating the needed media and profiles for your business in a way that allows local people that need your kind of products and services, can find you easily. You just need to fill up the form with all the details about the business information, and we will get working on it. The process is gradual and may take between a week or two, depending on what is needed. We will work on your request as soon as it is possible so we can get your business to be findable the soonest possible.

        During the process we will ask you questions and make some tests to ensure it really is easy to find your business with what is done. We wish we could control the market and with this make everyone go to your business, but unfortunately we cannot guarantee that will be the case. But we can guarantee your business will show up if people are looking for what you have to offer and they are in the area. At the end our purpose with this project is getting the local community to have a bigger chance to find out about your business' existence.
