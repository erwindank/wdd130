                <h3>This is how it works</h3>
                <p>The way it works is that we will help create the needed media and profiles for your business in a way that allows local people that need your kind of products and services, can find you easily. You just need to fill-up the form with all the details about the business information, and we will get working on it. The process is gradual and may take between a week or two, depending on what is needed. We will work on your request as soon as it is possible so we can get your business to be findable the soonest as possible.</p>
                <p>During the process, we will ask you questions and make some tests to ensure it really is easy to find your business with what is done. We wish we could control the market and with this make everyone go to your business, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that will be the case. But we can guarantee your business will show up if people are looking for what you have to offer and they are in the area. In the end, our purpose with this project is to get the local community to have a bigger chance to find out about your business' existence. </p>
