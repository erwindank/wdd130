        Hello all! My name is Erwin Solorzano. Very few people call me Dany but you can if you want. Most people just call me Erwin.
        I'm 29 years old. I was born in the covenant, so I've always been to church since I was a baby
        I served a mission in the Pocatello, Idaho, USA mission back in 2012-2014.
        I have 1 younger sister. I'm single, serving as a Family History & Temple Advisor. 
        I live in San José Pinula, Guatemala, just on the outskirts of Guatemala City, Guatemala. 
        I was born and raised in Guatemala City though.

        My major is Applied Technology. I really like Web Design and so I'm pursuing the closest thing to it that I can. 
        The reason I'm taking this course and major is because I want to create my own Web Design and Development business one day.  
        I love learning languages & working with technology. I am also very fond of video games; my favorites are Pokémon, 
        Legend of Zelda, and Splatoon. My favorite cartoon series is Avatar The Last Airbender/The Legend 
        of Aang, and The Legend of Korra; I'm a big fan. I love animals in general but I especially love dogs, so I own 3, 
        Loky (the mother), Kaiser, and Luka (siblings).

        The one thing I love the most about BYU-Idaho is the great amount of 
        options to customize my degree and that I can start learning what I really want right 
        away and I don't have to go through unrelated courses like Math and Physics and 
        stuff to get the knowledge I'm eager to get.

        I've worked as a Technical Support Supervisor, a Spanish/English interpreter, customer service positions,
        and as a Freight Broker. I'm currently working on finding a job that relates more to web design and development so 
        I can start getting some experience on the field.
